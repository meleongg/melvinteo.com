## Models of Computation

> “Logic doesn’t make sense”

### Semester: 2021 W2

### Instructor: Karina Mochetti

[Karina](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor?tid=2606722) was a light-hearted professor who really cared about her students and was always looking for ways to improve her teaching style. The majority of her lecture slides were accurate and relevant, but there were sometimes a few grammar mistakes. Karina also has a slight accent, so it could sometimes be difficult to understand her explanations.

### Structure:

CPSC 121 consisted of pre-lecture quizzes, weekly labs, weekly tutorials, four group assignments, one midterm, and the final exam.

Each week, we were expected to read ~10-20 pages from the textbook. Before each lecture, we completed pre-lecture quizzes that tested our knowledge of a portion of the textbook material. The quizzes consisted of a multiple-choice portion and a short-answer response portion. The multiple-choice questions were fairly straightforward; however, the short-answer questions were often very complicated but only marked for reasonable effort. Textbook readings usually took ~1 hour, and pre-lecture quizzes usually took ~30-45 minutes.

Weekly labs were hands-on applications of the previous week’s lecture material using actual circuitry called the “Magic Box”. Before each lecture, there were pre-lab Canvas readings to complete for marks. The labs themselves were very fun but also very stressful because you had a limited amount of time to complete a number of tasks, and your lab grade depended on the number of completed tasks.

Weekly tutorials were very relaxed and consisted of a TA walking through a handful of exam-level practice problems. Attendance was mandatory for participation marks.

The four group assignments presented, by far, the most challenging problems. Each assignment consisted of 5-6 problems using an online software called LaTeX, and deadlines were usually two weeks after the assignment release date. I would typically attempt to solve each problem on my own first and then meet with my group once a week to compare solutions. Summing up my personal efforts and group efforts, it took ~12 hours per assignment.

### Key Concepts:

**Logic Circuits:** Building circuits that perform certain functions (e.g. a 2-bit counter) using AND, OR, NOT gates, Multiplexers, etc.

**Logic Propositions:** Translating from regular English statements to logical representations called propositions and vice versa.

**Mathematical Proof Techniques:** Using a handful of proof techniques (e.g. Proof by Cases, Induction) to formally prove (or disprove) logical statements.

**How Computers Work:** Gain an introduction to how a computer functions under the hood and how its implementation can affect its computation speed. 

### Final Thoughts:

CPSC 121 was truly the first Computer Science course I took at UBC. As opposed to the hands-on, practical CPSC 110 course, CPSC 121 provides an introduction to the more theoretical, computational thinking side of Computer Science. Although I typically prefer practice over theory, CPSC 121 changed my perspective of Computer Science as more than just keyboard mashing until something works.
