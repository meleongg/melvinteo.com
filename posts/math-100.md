## Differential Calculus with Applications

> “Power rule supremacy”

### Semester: 2021 W1

### Instructor: Christoph Ortner

[Christoph](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor?tid=2717903) was a kind and patient professor but often spent too much lecture time answering student questions. Sometimes he would convolute the simplest explanations and leave the student more confused. His teaching methods can also be quite confusing and he assumed that all the students knew how to use mathematical symbols/shortcuts. 

### Structure:

MATH 100 was split into several topics that were introduced on a weekly basis. There were weekly problem sets called WebWorks that were assigned each week through an online platform called WebWork. The WebWorks usually consisted of ~18-20 questions of varying difficulty - some were no-brainers while others required the use of external software to compute solutions. It would usually take me ~6-8 hours to complete the WebWork assignments. Halfway through the course, there was a midterm of just above medium difficulty but not impossible. The final exam was also of similar difficulty. 

### Key Concepts:

**Limits**: The relationship between limits and derivatives. Limit laws.

**Derivatives**: The relationship between tangent lines and derivatives. Product, Quotient, and Chain Rules. 

**Applications of Derivatives**: A variety of real-world word problems that require the use of derivatives, such as Optimization, Growth & Decay, etc. 

**Taylor Polynomials**: Approximating a function using the derivatives of a bunch of other polynomials. 

### Final Thoughts:

MATH 100 was my first taste of a university math course and I was quickly humbled by the learning curve. I received my lowest-ever math grade on the midterm and quickly learned that I had to change my study approach. For the majority of the course, I seldom read the CLP textbook and stopped attending lectures after the first midterm. Instead, I resorted to watching Professor Leonard’s YouTube lectures that covered the same material.
