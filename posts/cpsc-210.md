## Software Construction

> "and I OOP"

### Semester: 2021 W2

### Instructor: Felix Grund

[Felix](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor?tid=2683645) was an incredibly engaging and encouraging instructor despite teaching the majority of the course online. His lecture slides were always accurate and contained relevant information. Felix also had experience working as a Software Engineer, so he occasionally showed code from his work that directly applied concepts we learned in class. 

### Structure:

CPSC 210 consisted of lecture tickets, weekly labs, a course project, one midterm, and the final. 

Before each lecture, we were expected to watch a few introductory topic videos (~15-45 minutes per lecture) on [edX](https://edge.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UBC+CPSC210+all/) and complete a lecture ticket based on the videos. Lecture tickets were multiple-choice and had unlimited attempts. 

Each week, we also completed a lab that directly applied the previous week’s material. Labs were typically straightforward and were due at the start of the next week’s lab. These labs typically took me ~2-3 hours to complete. However, during each lab, the TAs asked me questions about my previous week’s lab code, so I had to remember to review my previous week’s lab before attending. 

Throughout the semester, we completed a course project of our choice that was split into four different phases. Each phase came with its own requirements and all I had to do was check off all the requirements to receive full marks for each phase. In terms of difficulty, I would rank the phases as so: Phase 3 (48+ hours), Phase 1 (6-7 hours), Phase 4 (~1 hour), Phase 2 (~30 minutes).

The midterm was fair, and the final was slightly more difficult but still manageable. 

### Key Concepts:

**Object-Oriented Programming:** Learning the relationship between Classes and Objects using the Java programming language in the IntelliJ Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

**Version Control:** Understanding the power of manipulating version control history using Git and Github. 

**Testing and Debugging:** Writing robust code and thorough test suites. Using IntelliJ’s built-in debugger to squash bugs. 

**Software Design Patterns:** Implementing common design principles and patterns such as the Single Responsibility Principle and the Observer Pattern, among many others. 

### Final Thoughts:

CPSC 210 has so far been my favourite course at UBC. Not only is the course not too difficult, but I believe it’s the most practical course for those interested in real-world Software Engineering. During my technical experience, I have used many of the concepts taught in this course, especially drawing and interpreting UML diagrams. This course is also required for those wanting to participate in the UBC CPSC Co-op Program.
