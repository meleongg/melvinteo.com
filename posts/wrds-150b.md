## Writing and Research in the Disciplines

> “Remind your reader of the research question”

### Semester: 2021 W1

### Instructor: Jaclyn Rea

[Jaclyn](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor?tid=1394952) was an incredibly supportive and caring instructor. She provided students with clear criteria to follow and lots of positive and constructive feedback. Private office hours with Jaclyn were very helpful, but there was a limit to the number of them you could attend throughout the semester.

### Structure:

For WRDS 150B, the topics varied from section to section, but my particular section focused on “Reading and Writing Humour in STEM Fields”. The first half of the course introduced the structure of scholarly articles and how to effectively read them. During the second half of the course, we wrote our own literature reviews based on a research question that we came up with related to a given topic. Although writing a literature review was a daunting task, the course assignments were split into smaller steps that eventually congregated into a complete literature review. Also, there was no midterm or final exam for this course. 

### Key Concepts:

**Reading Scholarly Writing:** How to quickly read scholarly articles and capture the main research question(s), goals, and outcomes.

**Producing Scholarly Writing:** How to effectively convey research findings to a specific target audience.

### Final Thoughts:

WRDS 150B was my first time reading scholarly articles, so it was definitely an eye-opening experience compared to the traditional five-paragraph essay structure taught in high school. I don’t think I’ll produce scholarly writing ever again, but it was interesting learning how research is communicated between professionals with diverse backgrounds.
