Heyo! This is the first official blog post on my new website!

I'll be using this website to document my journey through tech, including interesting tips/advice/what-not-to-dos I've learned from school and during my leisure time.  

When I first started learning about Web Development, my [old website](https://meleongg.github.io/) was built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript - but I've learned **a lot** more since then. Looking back, that old website didn't actually look half-bad.

**DISCLAIMER**: I am not a designer by any means, but I do use Figma to prototype my site designs before developing. 

But the logic powering the site on the other hand, was *interesting*, to put lightly, considering that all the site content was contained in a single HTML file and styled by an equally massive CSS stylesheet. ðŸ¥²

However, this new version of my site was built using Next.js, a modern React framework that abstracts tedious (at least IMO) aspects of the usual web development process, such as setting up the different page routes. It also streamlines the site deployment process via Vercel. 

Throughout the development process, it felt too easy to set things up - features that took hours upon hours to implement in vanilla JS took minutes in Next. For example, I remember deciding against having a multi-page site because of how time consuming it would be to create a JS file and register event listeners to switch to different pages for every single navbar link. But with Next, all I have to do is create a component under the pre-existing *pages* folder, and I've got myself a working router! 

All in all, I'm pretty happy with how my updated site turned out, and I can't wait for all the things I'll be able to document here!
