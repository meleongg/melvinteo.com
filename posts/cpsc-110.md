## Computation, Programs, and Programming

> "Trust the natural recursion"

### Semester: 2021 W1

### Instructor: Gregor Kiczales

[Gregor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor?tid=38077) is the most iconic professor on the CPSC 110 teaching team. You will see Gregor everywhere throughout this course and internalize his golden nuggets of advice. Overall, Gregor is a kind and encouraging professor who will provide assistance to a certain degree, such that the student is still doing most of the heavy lifting. However, Gregor can sometimes come across as a little aggressive and harsh when answering student questions during a time crunch.

### Structure:

CPSC 110 was split into several modules that encompass a variety of topics. For each module, you could find pre-lecture videos on an online platform called [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-simple-data). If you're a keener, you could preview the entire course on edX before even registering for it. The pace of the module material is quite manageable and there were usually only around half an hour to an hour's worth of videos and ungraded mini-problems per module. Even less if watching at 2x speed!

To complement the lectures, there were weekly three-hour labs that gave you the opportunity to directly apply all the problem-solving concepts taught in lecture. These labs gradually became more difficult throughout the course, but the TAs were always patient and helpful. The lowest lab is also dropped.

Outside of allocated course time, there were also weekly problem sets that provided even more practice, usually targeted toward the more complicated lecture concepts. Problem sets also progressively became more difficult (beware of Pset 9), and you had to be aware of the increasing autograder submission cooldown. Personally, I spent around two to eight hours per week on problem sets, with the exception of Pset 9. Just like with labs, the lowest problem set is also dropped.

Another big aspect of this course is that most non-exam assessments are autograded through an internal tool that sends you feedback via emails. Finally, in terms of exams, Midterm 1 is usually straightforward for most students, but the difficulty of Midterm 2 and the Final Exam varies each year. The general pattern is that one of Midterm 2 and the Final will be of medium difficulty and the other will be challenging to compensate for Midterm 1.

### Key Concepts:

Dr Racket and Racket: Dr Racket is the IDE you'll be writing Racket syntax with.

Design Recipes: Common design recipes (i.e. coding patterns) specific to CPSC 110 (HtDF, HtDD, HtDW).

Natural and Generative Recursion: Perform repeated functions on two different types of trees, Binary and Arbitrary Arity Trees.

Search: Performing search tasks on trees and graph data structures. Arguably the most difficult concept of this course.

### Final Thoughts:

Coming from a background working with higher-level programming languages, learning Racket syntax was a little tedious due to its unique syntax. However, for those looking to pursue Computer Science, CPSC 110 introduces foundational CS concepts (tree traversals, graphs, etc.) that you will revisit in later courses, in other programming languages of course. All in all, CPSC 110 was a fair course that was rewarding given that you put in a corresponding amount of effort.
