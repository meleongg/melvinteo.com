The path to WebWork Green is one most travelled on, with its hardships and frustrations accompanying any traveller who dares attempt this journey.

If you’ve ever taken any MATH course at UBC, you’ve most likely had to complete these infamous WebWork assignments. For non-UBC students or UBC students who have yet to take a math course, Webwork is a website that professors use to assign weekly problem sets.

*WebWork Green* refers to the serotonin boost accompanied by this image shown only after completing all the problems in a problem set.

But obtaining WebWork Green is not always a walk in the park. Sometimes, the homework sets only take a few hours or so, and other times it’s as if the professors are setting you up for failure. Nevertheless, it’s always a good idea to complete WebWork problems as they are similar to problems that commonly appear on exams and also serve as a way to check your understanding. They usually count for around 10-20% of your course grade, so yes - please take any and all freebie marks when possible!

When I took my first MATH course at UBC (MATH 100 - Differential Calculus with Applications), WebWorks were due on Mondays. So my game plan would be to push my WebWork until the weekend after I had covered the entire week’s lecture material before attempting any problems. But by waiting until the weekend, I often forgot the lecture material from earlier in the week because I had not actively practiced the concepts. This led to much more time spent rereading lecture notes and watching YouTube videos. Also, if there were WebWork problems I had no idea how to solve, I could only rely on Googling and reading Piazza posts for help. There had to be a more efficient way to tackle these assignments.

During my second MATH course (MATH 101 - Integral Calculus with Applications), my WebWorks were also due on Mondays. But this time, I decided to employ the “Traffic Light Strategy” to complete my weekly problem sets.

## The Traffic Light Strategy

For each week in the course, complete each of the following phases:

### The Green Light Phase: 
After each lecture, open up WebWork and attempt problems starting from Problem 1 until you encounter an unfamiliar problem (i.e. the topic hasn’t been introduced in class yet). Skip any problems that have taken you longer than ~20 minutes with no progress and revisit them later. During this phase, make sure to document your thought process and rough work! 

### The Yellow Light Phase: 
After encountering an unfamiliar problem, try to complete it first, but don't worry if you're unable to. Preview the next couple of problems to see how they are structured and identify some potential concepts you might have to apply. By doing this, you’ll know what to focus on during the next lecture.

### The Red Light Phase: 
After putting genuine effort into solving the problems, stop. As you were working through the problems, you may have come up with some questions or gotten stuck. Write down these questions/problems somewhere and bring them to your next math lecture or to the Math Learning Center! I personally use a Notion page to keep track of my questions and ask them to my professors after lecture.

Repeat the three phases until the end of the week. By the weekend, you’ll have completed most of the problems and have at least an idea of how to do the incomplete ones. You won’t need to start from 0, and you'll have a better overall grasp of the week’s material.

## Extending the Metaphor 

For each problem that you complete, classify each problem as Green (easy), Yellow (medium), or Red (difficult) based on how you felt about your understanding of the problem. It doesn’t matter how you keep track of it, but it’s important that you do. For example, since I do WebWork on my iPad, I just highlight the problem number with the corresponding colour.

Categorizing each problem is crucial for exam preparation. I tend to forget material pretty easily when it comes time for exams, so when I return to past WebWork problems, I know that I can safely skip over the Green highlighted problems, slow down on the Yellow problems, and then redo and really think about the Red problems.

## Conclusion 

The Traffic Light Strategy is something I’m glad I stumbled upon, but it came as a result of my experimentation with different ways to learn most efficiently. I’ve employed this strategy for two UBC math courses so far (MATH 101, MATH 221), and I’ve been able to achieve WebWork Greens for every WebWork with not a significant amount of Piazza or Office Hour help. Furthermore, the Traffic Light Strategy encourages immediate practice of the material you have learned, which I believe is the best way to check your understanding and improve! 

I hope the Traffic Light Strategy proves itself useful.

A plethora of Webwork Greens awaits you!
