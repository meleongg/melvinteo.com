## Introduction to Computer Systems

> “Stack Overflow isn’t just a place to steal code?”

### Semester: 2022 W1

### Instructor: Geoffrey Tien

[Geoffrey](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor?tid=2727926) was a solid professor that clearly and thoroughly explained the course concepts. However, his lectures were not the most entertaining and his naturally monotonic voice did not help to keep me awake. But if you pay attention to his explanations and follow along with the in-class activities, you will learn lots!

### Structure:

CPSC 213 was split into weekly labs, weekly assignments, three quizzes, and the final exam. All the above coursework was submitted via PrairieLearn or PrairieTest. 

The weekly one-hour labs consisted of practice problems directly applying the current week’s content. Fortunately, labs were marked only for attendance and TAs walked through the solutions. 

The weekly assignments consisted of 8-10 problems that were more difficult than lab problems and exam-level problems. Assignments were by far the most difficult aspect of the course for me, taking upwards to 20 hours to complete each assignment. Fortunately, we were able to work in pairs to complete these assignments. 

The three quizzes and final exam were all completed via PrairieTest in a “gain-points-as-you-go” format such that you would know your score as soon as you submitted a question. In terms of increasing difficulty, I would rank the quizzes as followed: Quiz 3, Quiz 1, Quiz 2. I found the final exam to be of reasonable difficulty. 

### Key Concepts:

**Programming in C** Learning fundamental C syntax, most importantly related to memory management (i.e. pointers). 

**Writing SM213 Assembly** Reading and writing SM213, a simplified assembly language for CPSC 213. 

**Computer System Architecture** Learning fundamental parts of computer memory such as the stack, heap, CPU, registers, RAM, etc.  

**Asynchronous Programming** Learning asynchronous programming concepts and its benefits and disadvantages compared to synchronous programming. 

### Final Thoughts:

Practice is a MUST for this course. Complete all the practice questions on PrairieLearn and make sure to fully understand the concepts. Camp at TA office hours - there’s a reason why there’s an entire ICICS room dedicated to CPSC 213. There were multiple weeks throughout the course where I felt like a complete idiot, but I pushed myself to truly try to understand the material and ask questions!
