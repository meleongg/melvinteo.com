## Integral Calculus with Applications to Physical Sciences and Engineering

> “What’s that curvy S thing?”

### Semester: 2021 W2

### Instructor: Nahid Walji

[Nahid](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor?tid=2765558) was an amazing professor who could explain the most complex concepts in a simple and concise manner. He had excellent time management during lecture, and the pre-lecture and post-lecture slides were perfect for previewing and reviewing content. Nahid’s handwriting could be messy at times, but he always encouraged students to ask clarification questions.

### Structure:

MATH 101 consisted of weekly WebWork problem sets, two midterms, and the final exam. There was also a course textbook, but I mostly relied on lecture notes to study.

WebWorks typically consisted of ~10-15 problems, and were worth completion marks. Following my WebWork Traffic Light Strategy, I usually spent ~3-6 hours across the week to complete these WebWorks.

The first midterm was straightforward, but the second midterm was of medium difficulty. The final exam was also of medium difficulty.

### Key Concepts:

**Integral Tricks:** Learning a bunch of integral-solving tricks, such as U-substitution, Integration By Parts, etc. and when to use them.

**Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** Understanding the relationship between differentiation and integration.

**Solids of Revolution:** Calculating the volume of solids formed by curves revolved around different axes.

**Taylor Series:** Expressing a function as an infinite sum of other functions.

### Final Thoughts:

MATH 101 was overall a pleasant experience. Unlike MATH 100, MATH 101 was much more organized in terms of providing students with accurate information, and the teaching team was much more involved both in and out of class time. However, Integral Calculus was challenging and required a lot of practice to master the key concepts.
