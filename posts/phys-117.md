## Dynamics and Waves

> “Force equals mass times acceleration”

### Semester: 2021 W1

### Instructor: Ziliang Ye

[Ziliang](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor?tid=2650366) was a very knowledgeable professor with a subtle sense of humour (he dressed up as a furry for Halloween!). His lecture slides were tailored towards problems that students struggled with most from Reading Quizzes and Tutorials Tests, which was very helpful. However, Ziliang did have a bit of an accent, which could make it difficult sometimes to understand his explanations. 

### Structure:

A typical week in PHYS 117 consisted of reading around 15-20 textbook pages and then completing an open-book Canvas Reading Quiz. Every other week or so, we would also have Tutorial Tests. 

Since Reading Quizzes were mainly used to check our understanding of textbook readings, the ~10 assigned problems were typically more straightforward than exam problems. The textbook reading normally took me around 1-2 hours and the Reading Quiz took me around 30 minutes to complete. 

Tutorial Tests were an hour long and consisted of ~10-15 questions that included more exam-level problems. We were also allowed to bring a double-sided cheat sheet to Tutorial Tests. 

Throughout the semester, there were 10 Reading Quizzes, with the lowest two dropped and 7 Tutorial Tests, with the lowest one dropped. The midterm was fair, but the final exam was brutal. To make matters worse, PHYS 117 had a pass-final-pass-course rule, so it was quite a stressful time waiting for my course grade to be released.  

### Key Concepts:

**Kinematics**: 2D and 3D Kinematics involving velocity, time, distance, and acceleration. 

**Forces**: How forces such as friction force, spring force, normal force, etc. act on an object and contribute to the net force. 

**Energy**: The conservation of energy, the work-energy theorem, and energy transfer in collisions. 

**Waves:** Interpreting information from a wave graph representing oscillations. 

### Final Thoughts:

Overall, PHYS 117 essentially covered the same topics as British Columbia’s Physics 12 curriculum, except that the problems were more complex. I really enjoyed this course because I felt that the concepts were very applicable to the real world. For example, I would have never really thought about the fact that friction not only stops things from moving but also allows things to start moving. However, I don’t think I’ll be taking another PHYS course at UBC because the upper-year material becomes too theoretical for my taste.
