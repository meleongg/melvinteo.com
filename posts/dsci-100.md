## Introduction to Data Science

> “Data is everywhere around us. You are a data point!”

### Semester: 2021 W2

### Instructor: Rodolfo Lourenzutti

[Rodolfo](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor?tid=2693521) was a kind professor who was quite personal with his students. He was always trying to cheer us up by cracking random jokes or sharing news from his personal life, such as when he and his wife welcomed a newborn to their family! His lectures went by pretty slowly since most of the content was copied and pasted from the textbook.

### Structure:

DSCI 100 was split into weekly lecture worksheets, weekly tutorial worksheets, and three quizzes.

The weekly lecture worksheets consisted of simple comprehension and coding problems with solutions that could be found in the textbook. After skimming the corresponding textbook chapter, I usually completed these lecture worksheets on the commute home from UBC in ~30 minutes.

Tutorial worksheets included more difficult problems, mostly coding but some comprehension. These worksheets tended to be more tedious and required that you carefully read the textbook. It would take ~40-45 minutes to reread certain textbook sections to complete tutorial worksheets.

The three open-book quizzes were completed via Canvas and were overall very straightforward. I would highly recommend creating an organized cheat sheet with Google Docs to take advantage of the cmd/ctrl + f feature due to the 50-minute time crunch for each quiz. Also, remember to read the questions carefully and submit your answers following the format they ask you to submit them in.

### Key Concepts:

**Jupyter Notebook and R:** Learning to use the R programming language with the Jupyter Notebook software to work with dataset files.

**Organizing Data:** Cleaning data entries, wrangling datasets, and creating effective visualizations.

**Predicting with Datasets:** Using KNN Classification, Linear & KNN Regression, and Inference on datasets.

### Final Thoughts:

DSCI 100 was overall a relaxed course compared to the other ones I took this term. My familiarity with coding prior to this course definitely helped me learn R more quickly; however, even if I had never coded before, I still don’t think I would have struggled with learning R since the syntax is quite human-friendly, and the textbook explains most of the code. This course also provided an excellent introduction to the field of Data Analysis - great for aspiring Data Scientists!
